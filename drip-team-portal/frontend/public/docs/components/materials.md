# Materials

## Materials Project Integration

The component detail page includes a material selector with access to 220k+ materials from the Materials Project API.

## Selecting a Material

1. Open component detail page
2. Use the material selector to search
3. Select a material from results
4. Properties are inherited automatically

## Property Inheritance

When a material is selected:
- Material properties are added to the component
- Inherited properties marked with "From material:" in notes
- Can be overridden with custom values

## Material Properties

Common properties inherited from Materials Project:
- Density
- Thermal conductivity
- Specific heat
- Young's modulus
- Poisson's ratio
- Electrical resistivity

## Custom Materials

For proprietary or exotic materials not in Materials Project:
1. Create component without material selection
2. Manually add required properties
3. Use TEXT property for material specification notes
